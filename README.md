# Matrix Visualization Tool
The tool is helpful for visualizing distance matrices and matrices in general. The aim of the algorithms made available (taken and modified from jdfekete/reorder.js) and other options such as subsampling is to help visualize the datasets used and mentioned in the Edit Distance Between Merge Trees by Raghavendra, Dr. Vijay Natarajan et al (link to the paper: https://vgl.csa.iisc.ac.in/pub/paper.php?pid=056). 
## Using The Tool
The repository can be downloaded/cloned and the file reorder.js/examples/visualize_given_matrix/index1.html can be opened in any browser for the matrix. Several sample files are present in the directory visualize_given_matrix.
